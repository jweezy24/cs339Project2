# Cs339Project2

We build a system of objects that listen to each other on multiple networks. SERVER ONLY WORKS ON DEBIAN BASED OPERATING SYSTEMS.

## Getting Started

There are three files to run if the user would like to run everything locally.

1) C Server
    To compile, (be in Cs339Project2/src/server) `sudo make install`, then `make`
    To run, `./test.exe 7999`     
    The C server code will be running on a server, this is to test everything locally

      * **Jack Broncato** - [jman11111](https://github.com/jman11111)

2) Python 3 Device Manager
    This will always run locally, this acts a middle man between the c server and a local network.
    To run this, (be in Cs339Project2/src/local) `python3 deviceManager.py`
    To test locally or over multiple networks, device manager has to be run on each machine.

3) Python 2.7 Hardware Simulation
    To simulate plugging devices in at the lowest level we developed scripts to be run as hardware.
    This is a console application, to run (be in Cs339Project2/src/local) `python pluginObject.py <name of object>`
    This will give you commands to create objects that will send signals to a locally running device manager.

4) Python 2.7 Front-End
    For the user to send commands to their lights, we developed a front-end communication system to send commands to any light on the user's LAN.
    To build, run the command `python devicesTest.py`

## Functionality

  #### C Server ####

  * Three distinct levels of operation. (Device Simulation -> Local network manager -> Main server)

  * Sends Json messages over UDP socket functionality

  * Times out device managers after a period of time.

  * Add devices to device manager

  * Delete individual devices

  * Device manager sends out heartbeats every other second.

  * Server reads the heartbeats as "routine" packets.

  * If the server restarts, it rebuilds itself using routine packets.

  #### Device Manager ####

  * Builds objects from heartbeats from hardware

  * Uses multicast to update objects

  * Uses TCP to connect to a front-end

  * Can schedule tasks at specific times in a new thread

  * Front-end TCP connection lives in a new thread

  * Turn on/off lights based off of assigned port

  * Parses json messages to trigger events and build objects

  * Times out objects after not getting a heartbeat for 2-4 seconds

  #### Front End ####

  * Python console application

  * Issues commands over a TCP connection to device manager

  * Able to issue turn on/off, list, and schedule commands

  * Error catching, can be booted up before or after the DM

  * Closes sockets such that it does not break the DM

  #### Device Simulator ####

  * Creates a instance of a device that sends heartbeats to a local DM

  * Can be changed by json messages sent by DM





## Installing


Local:
Download the repo. Make sure you have a compiler for Python27 and Python3, you do not need a C compiler.

Server:
The server currently only runs on a debian based linux distro. While in the server directory (Cs339Project2/src/server), run `sudo make install`. That will install all the packages need to handle the server. Then `make` to build the server.

## Running the tests

* In cs339Project2/test/local `python objectTests.py` - Runs Object related tests (31).

* In the cs339Project2/test/server run the commands `sudo make install` then `make` then `./testing.exe` (27).

* In cs339Project2/test/local `python DMTests.py` - Runs DM related tests (5).

  Total Tests = 63

## Built With/Requirements

* [Python27](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) - The compiler for device simulator

* [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-372/) - The compiler for device manager

    * [Netifaces](https://pypi.org/project/netifaces/) - This package is needed for device manager to grab ip

* [C](http://gcc.gnu.org/install/) - The compiler for C (All C dependencies will be installed with make file)

    * [json-c](https://github.com/json-c/json-c) - dependency for server. Parses json args.

    * [googleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) - Dependency for C tests
